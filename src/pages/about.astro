        I'm CJ. I work in communications, make videos, build systems, and think about how tools
        connect to purpose and realness.
      </p>

      <p>
        This site exists because I have conceptual ideas that feel too big to just keep to myself.
        What's the point of an idea if it isn't shared?
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-4">The AI Thing</h2>

      <p>
        Everything here is vibed out with AI. I'm not pretending otherwise.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ideas are mine — the dot-connecting, the "what if" moments, the conceptual frameworks.
        But the execution? That's collaborative. I think alongside these tools. They help me
        articulate what I'm seeing, move from concept to artifact quickly, catch the vibe while
        it's still fresh.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm not interested in pretending I'm doing this alone. I'm interested in what becomes
        possible when you're honest about the process and transparent about the collaboration.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-4">What You'll Find Here</h2>

      <p>
        Concepts. Systems. Half-baked ideas. Tracks made with Suno. Frameworks for doing
        creative work differently. Observations about how church communications could work better.
        Thoughts on tools and workflows and what makes things actually cool vs. just technically impressive.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not every idea is polished. Not every concept is complete. That's kind of the point —
        this is thinking out loud, in public, with receipts.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-bold mt-12 mb-4">Connect</h2>

      <p>
        If something here resonates, cool. If you want to work together on something, even better.
        You can find me on socials or just shoot me an email.
      </p>

        This site is built with Astro, styled with Tailwind, and deployed for free.
        Because ideas shouldn't require a budget.
